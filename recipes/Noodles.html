        <p class="preparation">
            It is best to get all the ingredients ready before you start cooking. This cooks quite fast
            so failure to get the ingredients ready beforehand can cause the noodles to be overcooked.
            <br><strong>You Should;</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Peel your Onions, wash and chop them together with the Carrot and Green beans then set aside.</li>
                <li>If you’re using Chicken, wash them, boil and fry them. If Eggs, boil them and set aside.</li>
                <li>Chop the sausages into small cylindrical chunks and set aside separately.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>You’re now ready to get down to business!</b>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 2 glasses of water into a clean pot and leave to simmer on medium flame.</li>
                <li>Add spices (in the Ramen packet), add mixed vegetables with chopped pepper and onions 
                    and allow to boil for 1 minute. Make sure the Pot is covered from the beginning.</li>
                <li>Now break the Noodles and pour into the boiling water with all those ingredients already in. 
                    Distribute it evenly around the pot then cover. Leave to cook for 5 minutes while occasionally stirring it so the heat goes around.</li>
                <li> Just before it is done, add the Sausages (you want them semi cooked so they can retain a little grit).</li>
                <li>Once it’s cooked and the tenderness is to your liking, serve hot together with your Chicken or Eggs on the plate.</li>
            
            </ol>
